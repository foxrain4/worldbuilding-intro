  <h1 style="color: #f4d35e; text-align: center;">üåç Introduction to Worldbuilding in Games</h1>

  <p>
    Worldbuilding is the art of crafting the setting, rules, and feel of a fictional universe. Whether it‚Äôs a sprawling RPG or a small indie card game, a well-built world invites players to explore, imagine, and invest.
  </p>

  <p>
    This page is a beginner-friendly guide to understanding what worldbuilding means for games, and how you can start building your own.
  </p>

  <h2 style="color: #ff9f1c;">Why Worldbuilding Matters</h2>

  <p>
    In games, worldbuilding isn‚Äôt just background lore‚Äîit‚Äôs how your world feels and functions. It affects everything from how characters behave, to the design of levels and even card mechanics.
    A solid world creates consistency, immersion, and creative constraints that help design better gameplay.
  </p>

  <h2 style="color: #ff9f1c;">Key Elements to Consider</h2>
  <ul style="padding-left: 1.5em;">
    <li><strong>Geography:</strong> What does the world physically look like?</li>
    <li><strong>Cultures & Factions:</strong> Who lives there? What do they believe?</li>
    <li><strong>Magic/Tech Systems:</strong> How do unusual powers work?</li>
    <li><strong>History:</strong> What‚Äôs happened before the current game‚Äôs events?</li>
    <li><strong>Tone & Genre:</strong> Is it hopeful? Dark? Satirical?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="color: #ff9f1c;">Examples in Action</h2>

  <p>
    Some modern open-world games use harsh environments and minimalist storytelling to emphasize loneliness or resilience. A simple mountain trek becomes a metaphor.
  </p>

  <p>
    Classic online games based on ancient mythologies build immersion through themed cities, music, and even costume design‚Äîplayers might not read any lore, but they feel it through gameplay loops.
  </p>

  <p>
    In text adventures, every object and rule is described through writing, forcing the logic of the world to emerge from verbs and nouns. You can open, burn, or trick a puzzle‚Äînot because the game tells you to, but because the world expects it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tabletop RPGs often rely on just a map and a magic system. The stories come from shared imagination, but the world stays believable thanks to structured mechanics and limitations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even trading card games create entire worlds through repeated visual motifs and ability keywords. You start to recognize rival factions, planes of existence, or elemental forces‚Äîwithout needing a rulebook.
  </p>

  <h2 style="color: #ff9f1c;">What‚Äôs Next?</h2>
  <p>
    This is just the starting point. Worldbuilding can be visual, mechanical, or deeply narrative. In the next pages, we‚Äôll break it down further:
